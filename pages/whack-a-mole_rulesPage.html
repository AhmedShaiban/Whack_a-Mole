            <li>The goal of the game is to hit as many moles as possible within a set time limit.
                </li>
            <li>Players use a mallet or hammer to hit the moles as they pop up out of holes in a table or other playing surface.
                </li>
            <li>Each mole that is hit scores one point.
                </li>
            <li>If a mole is not hit before it fully pops out of the hole, no points are scored.
                </li>
            <li>The game continues until the time limit is reached.
                </li>
            <li>The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.
                </li>
     
    
        <h1>Here are some additional tips for playing Whack-a-Mole:</h1>
            <li>Be patient and wait for the moles to pop up before you hit them.
                </li> 
            <li>Try to hit the moles in the center of their heads for the most points.
                </li>
            <li>Don't be afraid to move around the table to hit moles in different areas.
                </li>
